## Nicotine changes how your brain and your body function. The net results are somewhat of a paradox: Nicotine can both invigorate and relax. Nicotine initially causes a rapid release of adrenaline, the "fight-or-flight" hormone. If you've ever jumped in fright at a scary movie or rushed around the office trying to finish a project by your deadline, you may be familiar with adrenaline's effects: rapid heartbeat, increased blood pressure and shallow breathing Â– this will quickly mellow as the nicotine dose wears off. The nicotine dose brings the initial onset of an actual cigarette without the harmful side effects.
