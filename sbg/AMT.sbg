## AMT 
## Stimulant (VERY STRONG) 
## 35 Minutes
## 
## AMT is a long-acting, synthetic psychedelic and euphoric stimulant. 
## The stimulant effects are like amphetamine, with the visuals being 
## similar to LSD, though less intense. The mental effects are also 
## similar to LSD, only less intense. This comes with a warning: there 
## will be a definite crash. The intensity of the crash may bring on 
## exhaustion or extreme tiredness. Positive effects include: increase 
## in energy, mood lift and smiling, visual patterning and closed-eye 
## visuals, increased awareness and appreciation of music, and 
## empathogenic qualities. This is truly a powerful dose with a 
## sometimes-strong comedown that makes this dose a true epic 
## experience, a journey.
