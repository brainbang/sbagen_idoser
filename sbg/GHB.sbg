## GHB can relieve anxiety and produce relaxation. Combining use with 
## other drugs such as alcohol can 
## result in nausea, loss of muscle

## GHB may also produce insomnia, 
## anxiety, tremors, and sweating.  As the dose increases, the sedative 
## effects may result in sleep and eventual coma-like trance. Other
