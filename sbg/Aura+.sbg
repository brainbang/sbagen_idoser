## An aura is a field of electromagnetic energy surrounding the body of 
## living beings. It shows itself as bright colors and can be used in 
## healing. The colors of an aura can be used to determine a person's 
## mood or overall energy. Aura+ is a psychological corrector. If you 
## are currently experiencing a negative aura (black or grey), this dose 
## will attempt to stabilize you to a higher lifting aura state of 
## glowing variety: Red, headstrong. Yellow, happy. Blue, deep. Perfect 
## for negative aura experiences like when you feel down or out, with no 
## obvious reason. You could just need aura alleviation through gentle 
## soothing correction.
