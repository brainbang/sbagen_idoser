## Sedative (Moderate)

## 45 Minutes
## 
## Chloroform is a volatile liquid that was used as an anaesthetic 
## during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and I-Doser has spent 
## years researching the effects of trichloromethane as an Anesthetic 
## Volatile Solvent. This is a slow reacting dose in similar mimic to 
## the experience: After the 10 minutes you will not feel anything. 
## However, after that threshold a slow intoxication sets in. Your head 
## begins to pleasantly throb as the intoxication washes over you. There 
## is a distinctive waah waah wahh in your ears that increases the 
## further you go. Your vision may become grainy but detailed at the 
## same time. As the dose passes 75 percent the experience takes on a 
## bodily turn, your midsection and face becomes 'pseudo-numb.' It feels 
## like jelly. Despite this, the feeling in your centre and extremities 
## is still present; if it is touched the stimulation feels as it would 
## always feel. As you come to the edge of consciousness, the dose will 
## end, and leave you stranded.
