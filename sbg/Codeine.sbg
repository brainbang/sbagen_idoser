## and all semi and fully synthetic drugs with morphine-like effects. 
## While this done may feel similar in effect to our Heroin and Demerol

## You will feel light-headedness, but not dizzy or disoriented. Lucid 
## mind, thinking about nothing in particular but focus, when required, 
## is easily obtained. Calm exterior, with a warm fuzzy body feeling. 
## Minor balance/coordination issues, similar to drunkenness, only 
## without the idiocy and toxic body feeling. This is a great 
## introduction, easy and mellow,
