## Datura 
## 
## Hallucinogenic (Experimental) 
## 
## 45 Minutes
## 
## Are you ready for something like this: "blind as a bat, mad as a 
## hatter, red as a beet, hot as hell, dry as a bone, the bowel and 
## bladder lose their tone, and the heart runs alone. Eat a little, and 
## go to sleep. Eat some more, and have a dream. Eat some more, and 
## don't wake up." The effects of Datura have been described as a living 
## dream: consciousness falls in and out, people who don't exist or are 
## miles away are conversed with, and hallucinations cannot be 
## distinguished from reality. The only REAL trance available.
