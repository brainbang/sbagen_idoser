## The Buddha described Nirvana as the perfect peace of the state of 
## mind that is free from craving, anger, fear, hurt, pain, and other 
## afflictive states. The subject is at peace with the world, has 
## compassion for all and gives up obsessions and fixations. This peace 
## is achieved when the existing volitional formations are pacified, and 
## the conditions for the production of new ones are eradicated. In 
## Nibbana the root causes of craving and aversion have been 
## extinguished such that one is no longer subject to human suffering or 
## further states of rebirths. I-Doser has achieved symmetry, oneness, 
## completeness with the world, the universe, you.
