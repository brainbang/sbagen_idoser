## We have synthesized the effects of animal hibernation on humans to 
## produce the strongest and most powerful sleep dose available. 
## Hibernation is a state of inactivity and metabolic depression, 
## characterized by lower body temperature, slower breathing, and lower metabolic rate. 
## Hibernating conserves energy by tapping energy 
## reserves such as body fat at a slow rate. It is this slowed metabolic 
## rate which leads to a reduction in body temperature and the deepest 
## longest sleep possible.
